# Othello Game AI

This is a simple implementation of the Othello game in Java. The game is played on an 8x8 board and follows standard Othello rules. Players take turns placing their pieces on the board with the goal of having the most pieces on the board when the game ends.

# Installation

To run this program, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/.
You can then download the source code from this repository and compile it using a Java compiler.

# Usage

To play the game, simply run the compiled OthelloGame.class file. The game will prompt you to enter your move, and will display the current state of the board after each move.
To make a move, enter the row and column of the cell where you want to place your piece. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 8.
The game will continue until the board is full or one player cannot make a move. The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins.

# Acknowledgements

This program was inspired by the Othello game implemented in the book "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig.
